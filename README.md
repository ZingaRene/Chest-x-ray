# Chest-x-ray
This repository contains documentation, notebooks, and reports on scientific experiments related to the use of generative models (PGGANs
) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs, DenseNet121, ResNet, etc.) in the analysis of medical images, specifically chest X-rays.
The main focus is on anomaly detection and the generation of synthetic images to support AI-assisted medical diagnostics.
